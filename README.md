# Fashion_recommendor_system
With an increase in the standard of living, peoples' attention gradually moved towards fashion that is concerned to be a popular aesthetic expression. Humans are inevitably drawn towards something that is visually more attractive.  Unlike the conventional systems that rely on the user's previoushistory, this project aims at using an image of a product given as input by the user to generate recommendations since many-a-time people see something that they are interested in and tend to look for products that are similar to that. We use neural networks to process the images from Fashion Product Images Dataset and the Nearest neighbour backed recommender to generate the final recommendations.

## Introduction
In this project, we propose a model that uses Convolutional Neural Network ResNet50 and the Nearest neighbour backed recommender. The neural networks are trained and then an inventory is selected for generating recommendations and a database is created for the items in inventory. The nearest neighbourâ€™s algorithm is used to find the most relevant products based on the input image and recommendations are generated.
